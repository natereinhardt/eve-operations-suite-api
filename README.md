# EOS: Eve Operations Suite API

An app to mantain fleet operations within Eve Online.


###THIS APP IS A WORK IN PROGRESS###
I have a plan for it but it will take me a long time to get it there. The tech stack is new to me and I am learning as I go along. I plan to slowly develop it when I have time. 


Im starting this project from scratch with no generators to hopefully grasp a better understanding of the stack im using. Its going to be far from perfect and I expect to refactor the code base many times as it evolves

###Tech Stack###
- Express
- Nodejs
- MongoDb (with Mongoose)

###TO RUN###

*Assuming you have node and mongo installed*

Travel to the base directory of this project where you saved it.
####Setup####

This steps will download the required dependencies to run the app.

- 1: run 'npm install' 

####Running####
- 2: run 'mongod'  in a new console to start up your mongo database
- Finally: run 'node server' in a new console to start up the application

Now the server should be running on localhost:54321 :+1:
